This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). 🚀✨🔥

## Getting Started 🎯💡🚀

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. 🌍🔍📡

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel. 🎨🖋️💼

## Database Generation and Network Security with Vercel 🔐🗄️⚙️

### Database Implementation 🛢️📊🔧
Vercel provides seamless integration with various database solutions, including **PlanetScale, Supabase, and Firebase**. In this project, we will implement a **PostgreSQL database using Supabase** due to its real-time capabilities and Next.js compatibility.

- **Setup**: We will configure the database by connecting Supabase with Vercel using environment variables.
- **Data Handling**: The API routes in Next.js (`/app/api`) will interact with the database using **Prisma ORM**, ensuring efficient data fetching and mutation.
- **Security**: All database credentials will be stored securely in **Vercel Environment Variables**, ensuring no sensitive data is exposed in the codebase.

### Network Security 🔒🛡️🌐
Vercel ensures security in deployment by implementing several network security measures:

- **Automatic HTTPS**: Every deployed project is protected with **SSL encryption**, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **API Protection**: API routes will be protected using **JWT authentication**, ensuring only authenticated users can access the data.
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse, we will implement rate limiting using **Next.js middleware**.
- **Firewall and DDoS Protection**: Vercel automatically provides **DDoS protection and firewall rules**, enhancing application security.
